GRADER, PLEASE NOTE: The complete Report, including the process and the Conclusionb (below), are in the Word document in the repo. 

CONCLUSION

•	The majority (19 of the 27) of the Army forts have poverty rates that fall above the national poverty line.

•	There is a significant gap between the fort with the lowest poverty rate (Fort Belvoir) and the fort with the highest poverty rate (Fort Bliss). 

•	There is a weak negative correlation (-0.39) between population size and poverty rate. As the population increases, the poverty rate should decrease.

•	There is a weak positive correlation (0.20) between population and household income. As the population increases, household income should increase.

•	By limiting the study to the US Army branch only and to forts (large bases), it produced 27 bases. Limiting the study to one branch of the US military and limiting the size of US Army bases provided a glimpse into the possibilities. However, a study with all branches and all base sizes could provide greater insight. Further research would need to be done to determine what causations directly influence base location and poverty rate. 

•	The next iteration of this study should include socioeconomic factors that could create economically underserved communities around military bases, including light pollution, noise pollution (airplanes, helicopters, gunfire, etc.), and military personnel having a more transitory lifestyle.

•	Different population data, such as gender, race, etc., should be considered.
